# Test Conversation Script

## Turn 1 — Warm opener (gauge should show ~60, coach: "Keep checking in…")

```
Good morning everyone! Today we're learning about photosynthesis — how plants turn sunlight into food. Who can tell me what they already know about it?
```

> Expect: Maya jumps in eagerly. Gauge holds steady. Coach gives default hint since Carlos is already confused.

## Turn 2 — Complex language (gauge drops, coach warns about Carlos)

```
Photosynthesis is the biochemical transduction of solar electromagnetic radiation into chemical potential energy via chlorophyll-mediated oxidative phosphorylation.
```

> Expect: Carlos's engagement tanks (confused emoji). Gauge drops toward red. Coach: "💡 Carlos looks confused — try simplifying your language"

## Turn 3 — Simplify + call on Carlos directly (gauge recovers)

```
Sorry, let me say that differently. Carlos, think of it like this: plants eat sunlight like we eat food. Does that make more sense to you?
```

> Expect: Carlos re-engages slightly. Jake still drifting. Coach may flag Jake next.

## Turn 4 — Call out Jake (coach responds to disengagement)

```
Jake! Eyes up here — I need you on this one. If a plant is in a dark room for a week, what do you think happens to it?
```

> Expect: Jake responds (he reacts to direct callouts + enthusiasm). Gauge ticks up. Watch his emotional state shift from distracted → engaged.

## Turn 5 — Debate hook for Marcus (gauge climbs, Marcus engages)

```
Here's a controversial question: some scientists think we could engineer super-plants that photosynthesize 10x faster to fight climate change. Is that a good idea, or are we playing with fire?
```

> Expect: Marcus engages hard (he loves debate + agency). Maya probably jumps in too. Gauge climbs toward green. Coach: "✅ Class is engaged — great pacing, keep it up"

## Turn 6 — Encouragement for Priya (watch her bloom)

```
Priya, I've noticed you've been thinking carefully. I'd love to hear your perspective — there's no wrong answer here.
```

> Expect: Priya responds (she blooms with encouragement). Watch her emotional state shift from anxious → engaged. Gauge likely peaks here.

## Turn 7 — Disengage passively (let gauge drift, trigger re-engagement hint)

```
Let me just read you some notes from the textbook for a few minutes…
```

> Expect: Jake and Marcus drift (bored/distracted). Gauge drops. Coach: "⚠️ Jake is disengaging — try calling on them directly"

## Recovery — Pull them back

```
Okay I'm done talking — Marcus, you've been suspiciously quiet. What's wrong with everything I just said?
```

> Expect: Marcus re-engages. Coach may show: "✅ Marcus just re-engaged — keep the energy up"
