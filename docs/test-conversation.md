# Test Conversation Script

Use this script to demo all major features in sequence. Recommended setup: History, Ancient Rome, Grade 10.

---

## Turn 1 — Warm opener

```
Good morning everyone! Today we're going to explore Ancient Rome — one of the greatest empires in history. Who can tell me what they already know about it?
```

> Expect: Maya jumps in eagerly. Carlos may ask what "empire" means. Gauge holds steady around 60. Whisper Coach gives default hint.

---

## Turn 2 — Complex language (gauge drops, coach warns about Carlos)

```
The Roman Empire's longevity can be attributed to its sophisticated administrative bureaucracy, its standardized legal codex, and its military's tactical superiority in asymmetric engagements.
```

> Expect: Carlos's engagement tanks (confused emoji). Gauge drops. Whisper Coach: "Carlos looks confused — try simplifying your language."

---

## Turn 3 — Simplify + call on Carlos directly

```
Sorry, let me say that differently. Carlos — think of Rome like the biggest, most organized country you can imagine, with rules for everything and an army that almost never lost. Does that make more sense?
```

> Expect: Carlos re-engages slightly. Jake still drifting. Gauge recovers partially.

---

## Turn 4 — Call out Jake

```
Jake! Eyes up here. If you were a Roman soldier 2,000 years ago, what do you think your biggest problem would be?
```

> Expect: Jake snaps to attention — he reacts to direct callouts and relatable framing. Engagement ticks up. Emotional state shifts from distracted to engaged.

---

## Turn 5 — Debate hook for Marcus

```
Here's a controversial take: some historians argue Rome never actually fell — it just transformed into the Catholic Church and medieval Europe. Do you agree or is that just revisionist history?
```

> Expect: Marcus engages hard — he loves debate and agency. Maya jumps in too. Gauge climbs toward green. Whisper Coach: "Class is engaged — great pacing, keep it up."

---

## Turn 6 — Encouragement for Priya

```
Priya, I've noticed you've been thinking carefully this whole time. I'd love to hear your perspective — there's genuinely no wrong answer here.
```

> Expect: Priya responds — she blooms with encouragement. Emotional state shifts from anxious to engaged. Gauge likely peaks here.

---

## CHAOS MOMENT — Press "Inject Chaos" button

Press the red Inject Chaos button in the header.

> Expect: A random classroom event fires — e.g. "Jake's phone goes off loudly" or "Marcus gets up and walks toward the door." Watch students react authentically: Maya redirects the class, Carlos looks nervous, Jake apologizes or gets defensive. Engagement bars shift. Toast notification shows which event fired.

---

## Turn 7 — Recovery after chaos

```
Okay, let's refocus. Marcus, I want to hear your actual argument — do you think any modern country could collapse the way Rome did?
```

> Expect: Marcus re-engages. Whisper Coach: "Marcus just re-engaged — keep the energy up."

---

## Turn 8 — Disengage (let gauge drift)

```
Let me just read you some notes from the textbook for a few minutes…
```

> Expect: Jake and Marcus drift (bored/distracted). Gauge drops. Whisper Coach: "Jake is disengaging — try calling on them directly."

---

## End Session

Click "End Session" and wait for the Session Report to load.

> Expect: Performance Overview cards (Engagement, Comprehension, Participation, Inclusivity), Engagement Over Time chart showing individual student curves, Student Summary section, AI Coaching Feedback in formatted markdown, and Teaching Autopsy.

## Grade Level Comparison (Optional Demo)

Run the same Turn 1 prompt in a Grade 4 session vs a Grade 12 session to show grade adaptation.

Grade 4 Maya: "Oh oh oh! Did they have knights? Like shiny armor guys?"
Grade 12 Maya: "So the empire's administrative reach across three continents — how did they maintain coherence without modern communication infrastructure?"
