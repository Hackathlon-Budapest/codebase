# Test Conversation Script

Use this script to demo all major features in sequence. Recommended setup: Biology, Photosynthesis, Grade 9.

---

## Turn 1 — Warm opener

```
Good morning everyone! Today we're learning about photosynthesis — how plants turn sunlight into food. Who can tell me what they already know about it?
```

> Expect: Maya jumps in eagerly with a follow-up question. Jake curious but vague. Marcus already challenging the premise. Gauge holds steady around 60. Whisper Coach gives default hint.

---

## Turn 2 — Pull in Carlos and Marcus (baseline engagement up)

```
Carlos, Marcus — before I go further, what do you two think? Does anything about how plants work already make sense to you, or is it a mystery?
```

> Expect: Carlos attempts an answer (engagement ticks up from confused baseline). Marcus engages — he likes being asked directly and given room to think. Both avatars shift positively. Class average rises before the jargon bomb hits, making the contrast more dramatic.

---

## Turn 3 — Jargon bomb (gauge drops, coach warns about Carlos)

```
Photosynthesis is the biochemical transduction of solar electromagnetic radiation into chemical potential energy via chlorophyll-mediated oxidative phosphorylation.
```

> Expect: Carlos's engagement tanks hard (confused emoji). Gauge drops toward red. Whisper Coach: "Carlos looks confused — try simplifying your language."

---

## Turn 4 — First recovery attempt for Carlos (coach may persist)

```
Sorry — Carlos, think of it like this: plants eat sunlight like we eat food. Does that make more sense to you?
```

> Expect: Carlos partially re-engages. If his follow-up still shows confusion, the Whisper Coach will stay on — point this out: "The AI caught that Carlos is still not there yet."

---

## Turn 5 — Second Carlos attempt (coach clears) + Jake callout

```
Carlos — solar panel on a calculator. No light, no power, it dies. That's a plant. Jake! Same question — what happens to a plant locked in a dark room for a week?
```

> Expect: Carlos re-engages, coach hint clears. Jake snaps to attention. Two students recovered in one turn. Narrate: "The AI tracked both and updated only when they actually responded."

---

## CHAOS MOMENT — Press "Inject Chaos" button

Press the red **Inject Chaos** button in the header.

> Expect: Jake's phone blasts music. The whole class reacts — Maya tries to refocus, Marcus makes a comment, Carlos looks nervous. **Priya stays completely silent — that's her anxiety persona working exactly as designed.** Engagement bars shift across all students. Toast notification shows the event.

---

## Turn 7 — Redirect Jake after chaos

```
Jake — just you, nobody else. Since your phone's already out: is water a solid, liquid, or gas right before it evaporates? One word.
```

> Expect: Jake re-engages. The "just you, nobody else" signals to the AI that only Jake should respond. Class settles. Narrate the recovery arc on the engagement graph.

---

## Turn 8 — Marcus debate (engagement peak)

```
Marcus — here's a controversial one: scientists want to engineer super-plants that photosynthesize 10x faster to fight climate change. Good idea, or are we playing with fire?
```

> Expect: Marcus lights up hard. Maya jumps in too. Gauge climbs to its peak. Whisper Coach: "Class is engaged — great pacing, keep it up." Point to the engagement graph spike.

---

## Turn 9 — Priya blooms

```
Priya — Marcus just said it could backfire. Do you agree with him, or does your gut say something different? No wrong answer.
```

> Expect: Priya shifts anxious → engaged or curious. Engagement ticks up visibly. She gives a quiet but real answer. Point to the avatar change.

---

## End Session

Click **End Session** and wait for the Session Report to load.

> Expect: Engagement Over Time chart showing the full arc (low start → Turn 2 callout lifts it → crash at Turn 3 jargon → recovery → chaos spike → peak at Turn 8). Conversation backlog with every turn logged. AI Teaching Autopsy with per-turn annotations and tips. Read one tip out loud.

## Grade Level Comparison (Optional)

Run the same Turn 1 prompt in a Grade 4 session vs a Grade 12 session to show grade adaptation.

Grade 4 Maya: "Oh oh oh! Sunlight turns into food? Like magic?!"
Grade 12 Maya: "So if chlorophyll is absorbing specific wavelengths — does the plant's efficiency change based on light spectrum?"
